> Scan for vulnerable ports on your network

![Alt text](./srp.png "srp")

Have you ever tried deploying an app on a server before? You will realize sometimes we let some vulnerabilities while developing our app, and when its time for it to sit on the server network we often have some open port on our network which if exploited can lead to a loss or transgression of sensitive data. This simple tool helps you catch just that, your vulnerable ports.
